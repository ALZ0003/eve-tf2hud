#summary How to customize this hud.
==How to install==
Inside archive you'll find a folder called "HUD". Extract its contents ("resource" and "script" folders) to the following location

_Steam/steamapps/yourusername/team fortress 2/tf/_
==Overrides==
There is one more folder called "overrides". It contains alternative version of files that will allow you to change various elements.
Each override contains "resource" or "scripts" folder (sometimes both). Copy them to your game's folder, just like you did while installing the hud.
